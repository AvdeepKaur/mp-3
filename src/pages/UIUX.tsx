            <em>ALS Resource Website</em>
            <br />
            The ALS Resource App project for Boston Children's Hospital focused
            on enhancing an existing web application to assist ALS patients in
            identifying needs and accessing resources. I developed high-fidelity
            prototypes for key features, including an improved dashboard,
            comprehensive bookmarking system, and accessibility settings
            tailored for ALS patients. We emphasized motor accessibility,
            effective screen real estate usage, and responsive design for both
            desktop and mobile interfaces. We helped transform the app into a
            more user-friendly and accessible tool for ALS patients and
            caregivers.

            <em>Be the Messenger</em>
            <br />
            The BCS and Associates' Social Justice Mobile App project
            successfully developed high-fidelity prototypes for a comprehensive
            platform combining Dr. Chad Starks' course content with a community
            hub for social justice discussions. Our Team prioritized key
            features such as coaching services scheduling, community engagement
            forums, and user profiles, while focusing on an inclusive and
            action-oriented design approach. Our team was also selected to
            present about our project on Spark's Demo Day.
